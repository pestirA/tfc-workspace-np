# About
This repository demonstrates Using Terraform Cloud to provision a virtual machine (VM) and harnessing the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for additional resources that integrate with Terraform Cloud, which is a compelling strategy for modern infrastructure management. 

By leveraging Terraform Cloud, you can centralize, Terraform's infrastructure as code (IAC) management, enabling version control, collaboration, and automated provisioning. This simplifies the process of creating and managing VMs, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of configuration errors.

Google Cloud Platform, as the cloud provider, offers a wealth of resources and services, allowing you to seamlessly connect your VM to HCP. Whether you need to set up networking, storage, databases, or other components, GCP's extensive ecosystem provides the building blocks for a highly available and scalable infrastructure.

In summary, using Terraform Cloud in conjunction with GCP to provision VMs offers a powerful and streamlined approach to infrastructure management. It empowers you to achieve greater agility, reliability, and scalability while maintaining control and consistency across your infrastructure. 

This strategy not only simplifies the provisioning process but also enhances the overall performance and resilience of your applications and helps you realize the cloud operating model.
